Chat:
    the promts have to be good enough, so the npc stays in it's role
    short answers, chatgpt talks way too much
    staying on the topic, llms jump too fast
    realistic dialogue, chatgpt often sound too formal

Memory:
    Npc's should have a background story
    They should remember previous interactions or events

Interaction:
    TTS for the character, one of the hardest parts. The voice has to fit
    Image to Text model exists. A Multimodel Npc with vision
    STT if the user wants to speak himself (easy with whisper)

Problems:
    chatgpt is too expensive
    with context window you have about 100 messages/$
    also responses take too long to be immersed

A small llama-7b model would reduce compute cost by alot, finetuning one per character?
